# ðŸ’» Project : Exercise Tracker

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://exercise-tracker.freecodecamp.rocks.

Your responses should have the following structures.

Exercise:
```js
{
  username: "fcc_test",
  description: "test",
  duration: 60,
  date: "Mon Jan 01 1990",
  _id: "5fb5853f734231456ccb3b05"
}
```

User:
```js
{
  username: "fcc_test",
  _id: "5fb5853f734231456ccb3b05"
}
```

Log:
```js
{
  username: "fcc_test",
  count: 1,
  _id: "5fb5853f734231456ccb3b05",
  log: [{
    description: "test",
    duration: 60,
    date: "Mon Jan 01 1990",
  }]
}
```

## Tasks

- [x] You can `POST` to `/api/users` with form data `username` to create a new user.
- [x] The returned response from `POST` `/api/users` with form data `username` will be an object with `username` and `_id` properties.
- [x] You can make a `GET` request to `/api/users` to get a list of all users.
- [x] The `GET` request to `/api/users` returns an array.
- [x] Each element in the array returned from `GET` `/api/users` is an object literal containing a user's `username` and `_id`.
- [x] You can `POST` to `/api/users/:_id/exercises` with form data `description`, `duration`, and optionally `date`. If no `date` is supplied, the current date will be used.
- [x] The response returned from `POST` `/api/users/:_id/exercises` will be the user object with the exercise fields added.
- [x] You can make a `GET` request to `/api/users/:_id/logs` to retrieve a full exercise log of any user.
- [x] A request to a user's log `GET` `/api/users/:_id/logs` returns a user object with a `count` property representing the number of exercises that belong to that user.
- [x] A `GET` request to `/api/users/:_id/logs` will return the user object with a `log` array of all the exercises added.
- [x] Each item in the `log` array that is returned from `GET` `/api/users/:_id/logs` is an object that should have a `description`, `duration`, and `date` properties.
- [x] The `description` property of any object in the `log` array that is returned from `GET` `/api/users/:_id/logs` should be a string.
- [x] The `duration` property of any object in the `log` array that is returned from `GET` `/api/users/:_id/logs` should be a number.
- [x] The date property of any object in the log array that is returned from `GET` `/api/users/:_id/logs` should be a string. Use the `dateString` format of the `Date` API.
- [x] You can add `from`, `to` and `limit` parameters to a `GET` `/api/users/:_id/logs` request to retrieve part of the log of any user. `from` and `to` are dates in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. `limit` is an integer of how many logs to send back.
